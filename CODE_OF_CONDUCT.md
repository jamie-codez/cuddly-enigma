# 🌟 Our Community Code of Conduct

## 🤝 Our Pledge

We, the awesome humans behind this project, are committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment for
everyone, no matter who you are or where you're from. We celebrate diversity and are dedicated to providing a positive
experience for all contributors, users, and community members.

🌈 **All are welcome here** – regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity
and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,
or sexual orientation.

💖 We're building a space where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued. Let's make magic together!

## ✨ Our Community Standards

### 🚀 **Be Awesome to Each Other**

We're all here to learn, build, and have fun! Here's how we can create a positive space together:

- **Be Kind & Empathetic** 🤗 - Treat others with respect and understanding
- **Celebrate Differences** 🌍 - Different perspectives make us stronger
- **Give & Take Feedback Gracefully** 💬 - We're all learning and growing
- **Own Your Mistakes** 💪 - Apologize, learn, and do better next time
- **Lift Each Other Up** 🚀 - Help create opportunities for others to shine

### 🛑 **Not Cool, Dude**

These behaviors have no place in our community:

- **Harassment** 🚫 - No unwanted attention, sexual or otherwise
- **Hate Speech** ❌ - No racism, sexism, homophobia, or other forms of discrimination
- **Trolling** 🤡 - Keep it constructive, not destructive
- **Doxxing** 🕵️ - Respect people's privacy
- **Being a Jerk** 😒 - If you have to ask if it's okay, it probably isn't

## 🛡️ Keeping Our Community Safe

Our community leaders (that's us! 👋) are here to keep this space awesome for everyone. We'll:

- Be fair and consistent in enforcing these guidelines
- Take action when needed to protect our community
- Explain moderation decisions when appropriate
- Keep things transparent while respecting privacy

If you see something that doesn't feel right, let us know! We've got your back.

## 🌐 Where This Applies

This code of conduct isn't just for GitHub - it applies whenever you're representing our community, whether that's:

- On our GitHub repos
- In our Discord/Slack channels
- At meetups or conferences
- On social media
- Basically anywhere you're repping our community!

## 🚨 Need Help? Report It!

If someone's making you or others feel unwelcome, please let us know! Here's how:

1. **Reach out** to us at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD] 📧
2. **Be specific** about what happened
3. **Know that we've got you** - we'll handle it with care and confidentiality

All reports will be taken seriously and reviewed promptly. We'll respect your privacy throughout the process.

## ⚖️ How We Handle Issues

We're all human (except for maybe some of our CI bots 🤖), but we need to keep this space safe. Here's how we handle
things when they go sideways:

### 1. Oopsie Daisy! (Minor Issues)

- **What happened?** Someone used some iffy language or made a bad joke
- **What we'll do**: A friendly chat to help them understand why it wasn't cool
- **Goal**: Learning moment! 🎓

### 2. Not Cool, Bro (Moderate Issues)

- **What happened?** Someone crossed a line, maybe more than once
- **What we'll do**: A formal warning and possibly a short timeout
- **Goal**: Give space to reflect and come back better

### 3. Time Out! (Serious Issues)

- **What happened?** Someone's behavior is making the community unsafe
- **What we'll do**: A temporary ban (weeks to months)
- **Goal**: Protect the community while giving a chance to learn

### 4. Bye Felicia (Very Serious Issues)

- **What happened?** Repeated violations or something really bad
- **What we'll do**: Permanent removal from the community
- **Goal**: Keep our community safe and welcoming for everyone else
